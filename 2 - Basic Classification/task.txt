Write a logistic regression code using Python and train and test your code in Titanic Survival Prediction. (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview)
    You can use pandas DataFrame.
    You can use a well-known ML library like scikit-learn.
    In this time, the data is very noise and contains multi labels with multiple data types. Therefore, you should manipulate the data to use Logistic Regression algorithm.
    If you are struggling with data manipulation, below courses can help you: (kaggle.com -> under Learn tab)
        - Kaggle Intermediate Machine learning
        - Kaggle Feature Engineering
    (Optional) You can explore other classification algortihms inside scikit-learn: 
        - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-classifier-comparison-py is a very good examples of algorithm comparison.
