Train different neural network architectures to classify FashionMNIST dataset classes. You can find this dataset in PyTorch Datasets.
 (https://pytorch.org/vision/0.18/generated/torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST.html) 
You should try different convolutional layer parameters (kernel size, stride, channel numbers etc.) then train this networks with/without dropout/batch normalization. Prepare a short report.
